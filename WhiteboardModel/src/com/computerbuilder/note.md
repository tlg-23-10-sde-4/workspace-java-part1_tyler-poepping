# Hello Jay
- I was trying to follow the instructions to the best of my abilities. However, I wanted to challenge myself a bit with this so I added "components" or child classes.

- I wasn't really sure what to go with for naming convention here because usually I am just creating services or "Entities" which I would put in a package labeled "models" with a package correlating to whichever DB I was using at the time. 

- If this is not an acceptable naming convention your feedback is always appreciated!

- There is also some things in here that I know you did not teach yet however I have used them before many times.

# Items you didn't teach
- Scanner: 
  - allowing a user to input data into the terminal
  
- Nested Arrays:
  - Arrays within arrays, not a difficult concept. So much easier with JavaScript, miss it.
  
- Child Classes:
  - This is like every program ever built has these. Most of the time Its linking models with ID's or creating a List<Class/DTO/Object> yourThingHere.

- Formatter:
  - This just formats the date however you want to. You cannot use the string converted version as LocalDateTime when trying to save to a DB unless the Data Type is "String" 


- I Will verify everything built with you if need be. Thanks, Jay! Class is awesome by the way, super glad I signed up for this course!
